### Distance from a line to point Q

We define a point P on the line, and take the line segment of PQ = Q-P. Vector v is used to describe a line being parallel to it

```
d = (| v x PQ |) / |v|
```

### Equation of plane in 3-dimensions
Likewise v, n is a vector which is always orthogonal / normal to the plane. Po(x0,y0,z0) and n = <a,b,c>
```
a(x-x0)+b(y-y0)+c(z-z0) = 0
```

### Parallel & Orthogonal Planes
Two planes are orthogonal, if normal vectors of both plane's dot product is 0
Two planes are paralle, if normal vectors are multiple of each other

### Line of Intersection between two planes
You need to find 
1.) Point of the line
2.) Vector
