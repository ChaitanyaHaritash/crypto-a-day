# Symmetric Key Algorithm

Symmetric key means same key is used for encryption and the same key is used for decryption of the data. So, once the key is compromised then data encrypted from that key is at risk.


##### Algorithms that has to be covered 
```
AES - ECB, CBC, CFB, CTR
RC4
DES
3DES
```

##### Not so commonly used, but skim over through it
```
Twofish
Serpent
Blowfish
CAST5
Skipjack
```
