# Crypto a day
_Crash course style practical cryptography training_

_Aaditya Purani + Jonathon Kirkpatrick_

**Crypto a Day** is an effort to tackle systematically cryptography related problems ranging from various attacks - from basic xor'ing to Elliptic curves. The credits for all the questions goes to various CTFs and Individual challenge authors. 

### Why did you even create this?
For practicing practical cryptography. There are thousands of challenges related to practical cryptography which are featured in various CTFs but I haven't came across a place where those were bifurgated by attack-type categories. So, in order to keep track of progress and squashing crypto-attacks from trivial level to hard level. We thought to build this up to maximize our performance in terms of speed, solving accuracy and critical thinking skills. We are open sourcing it just because others who are direction-less in the vast ocean of practical ctf style cryptography could learn from it.

### Ok Ok, So this means all CTF challenges in one category, that's it?
Nope, we ourselves have attempted those challenges albeit some challenges are unsolved totally due to our time constraints. But as it's open source, you can fork, and record your solutions there. There are just few variety of challenge of same type of category. For instance,in case of weiner attack there is only one good challenge which teaches concept of weiner. Not the concentration of multiple ones. That's why it's called *crash course* for a reason. Our solutions / writeups there are not ideal or precise. It's a junk produced by our rigorous practice. You may want to remove our solutions and only focus on challenges by the flow.

### Interesting, So how do I proceed?
Well, I can't say for everyone. But that's how we did. First cryptopals, then the ideal flow is mentioned under `ctfs` folder. Again I iterate, the challenges inside `ctf` are from other previous ctf. We have not create/wrote challenge on our own. Full credits goes to those authors and CTF organizers. Only the `tutorial` & `resources` section is written by yours truly.

### Will it be maintained ?
Yes, I intend to keep this as my practice arena as well. So, I will solve / put new stuff to level up my skills.
